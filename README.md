# LAB | Express Cinema

## Introduction

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23629340/36983687-49a3d64e-2093-11e8-8b86-b11813f0cdba.png)

The goal of this exercise is to learn how to seed the database on your own and to be able to create a cinema web page, where we will display the list of movies. In addition to that, you will create a detail page, where more details will be shown for each movie individually.

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

Upon completion, run the following commands:

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Instructions

### Iteration 0 | Initialize the project

**This lab has the starer code based on the Express Generator.**
After forking and cloning the project, you will have install all the dependencies:

```shell
$ npm install
```

Now you are ready to start. ðŸš€

### Iteration 1 | Seed the database

First, we need to seed our database. Below you will find an array of objects with info for 8 movies. You should create two files:

- Create a folder `models` and in it add the `Movie.model.js` file for the Movie model;
- Create `seeds.js` file inside the `bin` folder and write the code necessary to seed the database.

Below find the seeds you should add to the `bin/seeds.js`. Based on the objects provided in the seeds, create a `Movie` model in the `models/Movie.model.js` file.

```javascript
// To insert in "bin/seeds.js"

const movies = [

// Add here the script that will be run to actually seed the database (feel free to refer to the previous lesson)

// ... your code here
```

### Iteration 2 | The Home Page

Now when you have all movies in the database, you shall proceed to getting them and displaying them to the user.
We need our home page. Simple and beautiful, you can use the `index.hbs` to create the following home page:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23629340/36986664-acd6af14-209a-11e8-816d-b62417239c53.png)

The `button` should be a link redirecting to the `/movies` route. (_You will create this route in the following iteration._)

### Iteration 3 | List the Movies

Proceed to creating the `/movies` route. We need to list all the movies we have in our database. You should create a `movies.hbs` file, and display a list of all the movies.
To summarize, in this iteration your goal is to create `/movies` route that will render `movies.hbs` view. This view should have all the movie titles and movie images displaying. In addition to this, as displayed on the image below, add the link _See more_ that should point to the each movie details page. (_You will be creating this page in the following iteration._)

### Iteration 4 | Display Movie Details

Finally, you have to create a view to display the details about each movie. You need a `movie/:id` route, where the user can check all the info about each movie, after clicking on the `See More` button shown on the `/movies` view.

That's it!
Happy Coding! :heart:
